<h2>Determinants of asset demand</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Wealth</strong>
<ul>
<li>The total resources owned by the individual, including all assets</li>
<li>More wealth means more available to purchase assets</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expected return</strong>
<ul>
<li>the return expected over the next period on one asset relative to alternative assets</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>
<ul>
<li>degree of uncertainty associated with the return on one asset relative to alternative assets
<ul>
<li>Risk Averse
<ul>
<li>Assume that people would like to purchase assets with a relatively low degree of uncertainty</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>
<ul>
<li>the ease and speed with which an asset can be turned into cash relative to alternative assets</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Theory of Portfolio Choice</h3>

<p>Ceterus paribus, the quantity demanded of an assets:
- positively related to wealth
- positively related to its expected return relative to alternative assets
- negatively related to the risk of its returns relative to alternative assets
- positively related to its liquidity relative to alternative assets</p>

<h2>Supply and Demand in the Bond Market</h2>

<p>Suppose a one-year discount bond: <br />
$F$ = face value of the discount bond <br />
$P$ = current price</p>

<p>$$ i = \frac{F-P}{P}$$</p>

<p>Each bond price is associated with a particular level of the interest rate.  </p>

<p>If the holding period is one year, then the return on the bond is equal to the interest rate as measured by YTM.  </p>

<p><strong>Bond demand curve</strong> shows the relationship between $Q<em>d$ and the price ceterus paribus <br />
- Demand curve is downward sloping $\Rightarrow$ at lower prices of bond, $Q</em>d$ is higher</p>

<p>See Figure 5-1 in lecture notes.  </p>

<h2>Market Equilibrium</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>market equilibrium</strong> occurs when the amount that people are willing to buy equals the amount that people are willing to sell at a given price</li>
<li>$B^d = B^s$ defines the equilibrium price (or interest rate)</li>
<li>When $B^d &gt; B^s$ there is excess demand; price will rise (or interest rate will fall)</li>
<li>Reverse also true</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shifts in the demand curve for bonds</h2>

<ol>
<li>Wealth
<ul>
<li>growing wealth shifts demand curve for bonds to the right</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expected returns
<ul>
<li>higher expected future interest rates shift the demand curve to the left (lower expected future return)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expected inflation
<ul>
<li>an increase in the expected rate of inflation shifts the demand curve to shift to the left</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risk
<ul>
<li>an increase in the riskiness of bonds causes the demand curve to shift to the left</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Liquidity
<ul>
<li>increased liquidity of bonds shifts the demand curve to the right</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>See table 5-2 for summary</p>

<h2>Shifts in the supply curve of bonds</h2>

<ol>
<li>Expected profitability of investment opportunities
<ul>
<li>higher expected profitability of investment opportunities shifts the supply curve to the right</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expected inflation
<ul>
<li>an increase in expected inflation shifts the supply curve to the right</li>
<li>encourage borrowing today, so increased issuance of bonds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Government budget
<ul>
<li>Increased budget deficit shifts the supply curve to the right</li>
<li>Finance deficit by selling bonds</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Changes in the interest rate due to changes in expected inflation</h2>

<h3><em>The Fisher Effect</em></h3>

<p>Changes in expected inflation affect BOTH demand and supply curves.</p>

<p><strong>Demand:</strong> if expected inflation rises, the demand for bonds falls, <em>shifting the demand curve to the left</em>
- Why does this happen?
    - Imagine you are a lender
    - Look at bonds vs real assets
    - Bonds give you nominal rate of return =&gt; lowers your expected return on bonds</p>

<p><strong>Supply:</strong> the rise i expected inflation also shifts the supply curve to the right
- Why does this happen?
    - Imagine you are a borrower (supplier)
    - The coupon payment in the future is expected to be a lower real payment</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>The equilibrium bond price falls, implying a rise in interest rate</li>
<li>Thus when expected inflation rises, interest rates will rise</li>
<li>This result has been named the <strong>Fisher effect</strong> after Irving Fisher</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to Figure 5-5 to see the correlation between interest rate and expected inflation.  </p>

<h2>Changes in interest rate due to a Business Cycle Expansion</h2>

<p><strong>Demand:</strong> as the economy expands, <em>wealth</em> is likely increasing, and the <em>theory of portfolio of choice</em> tells us that the demand for bonds will rise as well. <br />
Rightward shift in $D$.  </p>

<p><strong>Supply:</strong> as the economy expands, businesses are more willing to borrow because they are likely to have many profitable investment opportunities for which they will need financing. <br />
Rightward shift in $S$.</p>

<p>Supply curve shifts more than the demand curve such that the new equilibrium interest rate rises during economic expansion.  </p>

<p>Interest rate tends to increase during expansion and decrease in recession.  </p>

<h2>Supply and Demand in the Market for Money: <em>The Liquidity Preference Framework</em></h2>

<ul>
<li>an alternative model for determining EQ interest rate, developed by John Maynard Keynes, is known as the <strong>liquidity preference framework</strong></li>
<li>EQ interest rates are determined by the S&amp;D for money</li>
<li>Two ways to hold wealth: <em>Money</em> and <em>Bonds</em></li>
<li>Total wealth equals total amount of money and bounds <br />
$B^S + M^S = B^d + M^d$ <br />
$B^S - B^d = M^d - M^S$</li>
<li>Thus if the bond market clears, so too should the money market</li>
</ul>

<h3>Money demand in the Liquidity Preference Framework (LPF)</h3>

<ul>
<li>as the interest rate increases:
<ul>
<li>the OC of holding money increases</li>
<li>the relative expected return of money decreases
<ul>
<li>and therefore the $Q_d$ of money decreases</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quantity of money demanded and hte interest rate are negatively related</li>
</ul>

<h3>Money supply in the LPF</h3>

<ul>
<li>Assume that the supply of money is controlled by the central bank</li>
<li>Let $M^S =$ \$300 B</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shifts in the Demand curve for money</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Income effect</strong>
<ul>
<li>a higher level of income causes the demand for money at each interest rate to increase and the demand curve to shift to the right</li>
<li>when people earn more, they would likely like to spend more, and so they might need to carry around more cash</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Price-Level effect</strong>
<ul>
<li>a rise in the price level causes the demand for money at each interest rate to increase and the demand curve to shift to the right</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Shifts in the Supply curve for money</h2>

<ul>
<li>Assume supply of money controlled by central bank</li>
<li>an increase in the money supply engineered by BoC will shift the supply curve for money to the right (<strong>liquidity effect</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>See table 5-4 for summary of all factors.</p>

<h2>Money and interest rates</h2>

<ul>
<li>LPC leads to the conclusion that an increase in the money supply will lower interest rates: the liquidity effect
<ul>
<li><strong>BUT</strong> Friedman noted that an increase in the money supply might have other effects on the economy that make interest rates rise</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Income effect</strong> of an increase in the money supply is a rise in the interest rate because increasing the money supply leads to an expansionary influence on the economy (rise in national income and wealth)</li>
<li><strong>Price-level effect</strong> of an increase in the money supply is a rise in interest rates in response to the rise in the overall price level</li>
<li><strong>Expected-inflation effect</strong> of an increase in the money supply is a rise in interest rates in response to the rise in the expected inflation rate</li>
</ul>
