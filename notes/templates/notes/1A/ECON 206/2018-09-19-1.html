<h2>Interest rates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Factors to consider:
<ul>
<li>Inflation rate</li>
<li>Default risk</li>
<li>Opportunity cost of waiting to spend your money</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Consider a simple loan: <em>Loan $100 today and require $110 repayment in one year</em>  </p>

<p><strong>simple interest rate</strong> example: <br />
$i = \$10/\$100 = 0.10$ or $10\%$</p>

<p>$$ principal \cdot (1+i) = future $$</p>

<p><strong>Present value:</strong> a dollar paid to you one year from now is less valuable than a dollar paid to you today</p>

<ul>
<li>$i$ links the financial future with the financial present</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, $\$100 \cdot (1+i)^n$ where $n$ is the number of years and $i$ is the interest rate.</p>

<h3>Discounting the Future: Simple Present Value</h3>

<p>$PV$ = today's present value <br />
$CF$ = future cash flow or payment
$i$ = interest rate</p>

<p>$$ PV \cdot (1 + i)^n = CF $$
$$ PV = \frac{CF}{(1+i)^n} $$</p>

<h3>Four types of credit market instruments</h3>

<ul>
<li>Simple Loan
<ul>
<li>One payment (principal and interest) at the maturity date</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fixed payment loan (aka fully amortized loan)
<ul>
<li>makes the same payment, consisting of a part of the principal and interest, every period (such as a month) for a set number of years</li>
<li>multiple fixed payments at pre-specified dates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Coupon bond
<ul>
<li>makes fixed-interest payment (coupon payment) every period until the maturity date, when a specified final amount (face value or par value) is repaid</li>
<li>For example, a coupon bond with $1000 face value might pay you a coupon payment of $100 per year until the maturity date, and then repay the face value of $1000 at maturity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discount bond (aka zero-coupon bond)
<ul>
<li>A bond bought at a price below its face value (i.e, bought at a "discount") that pays zero coupons, and face value is repaid at maturity date</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Similarities</h4>

<ul>
<li>Simple loans and discount bonds make payments only at maturity</li>
<li>Fixed-payment loans and coupon bonds make payments every period (or at regular intervals) until maturity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Yield to Maturity</strong> is the interest rate that <strong>equates</strong> the present value of all cash flow payments received from a debt instrument with its value today (the current price)</p>

<h3>Simple Loan</h3>

<p>$PV$ = amount borrowed = \$100 <br />
$CF$ = cash flow in one year = \$110 <br />
$n$ = number of years  </p>

<p>$$ \$100 = \frac{\$100}{(1+i)^1} $$</p>

<p>Thus, the yield to maturity is 10% which is equal to the simple interest rate.</p>

<h3>Fixed Payment Loan</h3>

<p>$LV$ = loan value <br />
$FP$ = fixed yearly payment <br />
$n$ = years until maturity  </p>

<p>$$ LV = \frac{FP}{(1+i)} + \frac{FP}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{FP}{(i+1)^3} + ... + \frac{FP}{(1+i)^n} $$</p>

<p>Suppose you need a \$100,000 loan. You take out a fixed payment loan from the bank that has an annual interest rate of 7%.  </p>

<p>What is the yearly payment to the bank if you wish to pay off the loan in 20 years?  </p>

<p>$$ \$100,000 = \frac{FP}{(1+0.07)} + \frac{FP}{(1+0.07)^2} + \frac{FP}{(i+0.07)^3} + ... + \frac{FP}{(1+0.07)^20} $$</p>

<p>$$FP = \$9439.29$$</p>

<h4>Another example</h4>

<p>Suppose you need a $1000 loan. You take out a fixed-payment loan from the bank that requires you to make a yearly payment of \$85.81 for the next 25 years.  </p>

<p>What is the YTM?</p>

<p>$$ \$1000 = \frac{\$85.81}{1+i} + ... $$</p>

<p>Cannot solve by hand; requires a computer  </p>

<p>Solution: $i = 0.07$ so $YTM = 7\%$  </p>

<h3>Coupon bond</h3>

<p>$P$ = price of coupon bond <br />
$C$ = yearly coupon payment <br />
$F$ = face value of the bond <br />
$n$ = years to maturity</p>

<p>present value aka present discounted value <br />
interest rate aka discount rate  </p>

<p>$$ P = \frac{C}{(1+i)} + \frac{C}{(1+i)^2} +  \frac{C}{(1+i)^3} + ... +  \frac{C}{(1+i)^n}  +  \frac{F}{(1+i)^n} $$</p>

<p>Suppose: <br />
$P = \$1000$ <br />
$F = \$1000$ <br />
$C - \$100$ (i.e. coupon rate); $n = 10$</p>

<p>Calculation left as an exercise for the reader.  </p>

<p>$YTM = 10\%$  </p>

<h4>Three facts about coupon bonds</h4>

<ul>
<li>when the coupon bond is priced at its face value, the yield to maturity equals the coupon rate</li>
<li>the price of a coupon bond and the yield to maturity are negatively related
<ul>
<li>as the yield to maturity rises, the price of the bond fall</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the yield to maturity is greater than the coupon rate when the bond price is below its face value
<ul>
<li>the yield to maturity is less than the coupon rate when the bond price is above is face value</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Consol or Perpetuity</h3>

<p>A bond with no maturity date that does not repay principal but pays a fixed coupon</p>

<p>$P<em>c$ = price of consol <br />
$C$ = yearly interest payment <br />
$i</em>c$ = yield to maturity of the consol</p>

<p>$$ P<em>c = \frac{C}{1+i</em>c} + \frac{C}{(1 + i_c)^2} + ... $$</p>

<p>$$ i<em>c = \frac{C}{P</em>c} $$</p>

<h3>Discount bond</h3>

<p>$F$ = face value of the discount bond <br />
$P$ = current price of the discount bond</p>

<p>$$ i = \frac{F-P}{P} $$</p>

<p>Rearranging,</p>

<p>$$ P = \frac{F}{1+i} $$</p>

<p>The YTM ($i$) is negatively related to the current bond price</p>

<hr>

<h2>The distinction between interest rates and returns</h2>

<p>How well a person does financially by holding a bond for some period of time is determined by the <strong>rate of return ($R$)</strong>.  </p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>rate of return</strong> ($R$) depends on coupons received ($C$) <strong>and</strong> the price for which the bond is eventually sold:</li>
</ul>

<p>$$ R = \frac{C}{P<em>t} + \frac{P</em>{t+1}-P<em>t}{P</em>t} $$</p>

<p>where: $C/P<em>t = \textrm{current yield} = i</em>c$</p>

<p>$(P<em>{t+1}-P</em>t)/P_t =$ rate of capital gain $= g$  </p>

<hr>

<p>Refer to Table 4.2.  </p>

<p>In table 4.2, the holding period is 1 year but term to maturity runs from 1 to 30 years.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Look at second to last row:
<ul>
<li>Say interest rates rise to 20% at the beginning of the second year</li>
<li>"Price Next Year" column 4 = $\$100/(1+0.2) + \$1000/(1+0.2) = \$916.6$</li>
<li>If you do sell it a year in advance, you are selling it at a loss</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>$$ \textrm{Rate of capital gain} = \frac{916.6-1000}{1000} = -0.083 \textrm{ or} -8.3\% $$</p>

<ul>
<li>Look at 5-year maturity bond</li>
</ul>

<p>What price will you get if you sell the bond?</p>

<p>$$ P = \frac{\$100}{(1+0.20)} + \frac{\$100}{(1+0.20)^2} + ... + \frac{\$100}{(1+0.20)^4} = \$741 $$</p>

<p>Rate of capital gain is $(741-1000)/1000 = -0.259$, or capital loss of $25.9\%$  </p>

<p>When the interest rate goes up, you usually incur a capital loss if you sell before maturity.  </p>

<p>Rate of return = 10% + (-25.9) = -15.9.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>The return (i.e. rate of return) equals the yield to maturity only if the holding period equals the time to maturity</li>
<li>A rise in interest rates is associated with a fall in bond prices, resulting in a capital loss if time to maturity is longer than the holding period</li>
<li>Similarly, the more distant a bond's maturity, the greater the size of the percentage price change associated with an interest rate change</li>
<li>The more distant a bond's maturity, the lower the rate of return that occurs as a result of an increase in the interest rate</li>
<li>Even if a bond has a substantial interest rate, its return can be negative if interest rates rise</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interest-rate risk</h2>

<p>The risk level associated with an asset's return that results from interest-rate changes is its <strong>interest-rate risk</strong>.  </p>

<p>Prices and rate of return for <em>long-term</em> bonds are more volatile than those for shorter-term bonds.  </p>

<p>There is <strong>no</strong> interest-rate risk for any bond whose time to maturity matches the holding period.</p>

<h2>Real and Nominal interest rates</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nominal interest rates</strong> make no allowance for inflation</li>
<li><strong>Real interest rates</strong> are the interest rates adjusted for the inflation rate
<ul>
<li>more accurately reflects the cost of borrowing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding cash in your wallet. <br />
- This is what banks give you in terms of chequing or savings account interest rates  </p>

<p><strong>Real interest rates:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Ex ante</em> real interest rate is adjusted for <em>expected</em> interest rate</li>
<li><em>Ex post</em> real interest rate is adjusted for <em>actual</em> interest rate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fisher equation:</strong> <br />
$i$ = nominal interest rate <br />
$r$ = real interest rate <br />
$\pi^e$ = expected inflation rate  </p>

<p>Suppose you have \$1.  </p>

<p>$$ \frac{1i}{1+\pi^e} $$
$$ (1+r) = \frac{1+i}{1+\pi^e}$$
$$ (1+r)(1+\pi^e) = (1+i)$$
$$ 1 + r + \pi^e + r\pi^e = (1+i) $$
$$ i = r + \pi^e = r\pi^e $$
$$ i \approx r + \pi^e$$</p>

<ul>
<li>When the real interest rate is low, there are greater incentives to borrow</li>
<li>Low real interest rates reduces the incentives to lend</li>
<li>The real interest rate is a better indicator of the incentives to borrow/lend</li>
</ul>
