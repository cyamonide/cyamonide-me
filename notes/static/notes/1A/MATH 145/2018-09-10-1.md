__A1P12:__ What are all the things that I could prove?  
Make a system that will allow you cover all the theorems. There is a way to cover everything without writing an infinite number of theorems.  

If you can construct an example that agrees with all previous axioms but is not an integer, you do not have enough axioms.  
A1-4, M1-3, D1 are the only ones Jao included. Anything satisfying these "ring axioms" are "rings."  

$$Z, Z_n, R, C, (H), Q, Z[x]$$  

$$Z[x], Z_n[x], R[x] ...$$

$N, I$ are not rings. For example, there is no 0 in $I$.

Quaternions satisfy all but M1.  
S1 states that there are addition and multiplication operations.  

__General:__ If you want divide, you must define it.  
Find a set of axioms where only the integers satisfy them.  
For further reading, look up the _Grothendieck_ axiom.
