# 2018-09-07-1 Course Intro

This course will teach you tools for algebraic reasoning and proofs. The next course (146?) will teach linear algebra using your newfound reasoning and proof.  
No solutions will be given. What you do is what you get out of the class.  
In this class, often you are expected to come up with the question and not the answer.
