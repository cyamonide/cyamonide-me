$0 != 1$ in a field.  
A field is an algebraic object with division.  
It is justified for fields for $0 != 1$ to be an axiom.  

__Archimedian axiom:__  
For every real there is a integer larger than it.

Take x, break up into integer and fractional part, and it'll pretty much be done.  
The math is easy, but the implementation in Coq is complex. There is, however, a short proof.  

$Z^*$ means the set of all invertible elements.
