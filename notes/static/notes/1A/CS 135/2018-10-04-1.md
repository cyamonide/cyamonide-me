# Functions

## Thinking about list functions

What does the function produce in the base case?  
What does the function do to the first element in a non-empty list?  
How does the function combine the value produced from the first element with the value obtained by applying the function to the rest of the list?  

__Recursive function__

Function that calls itself from within.

The full trace contains too much detail, so instead we use a __condensed trace__ of the recursive function, which skips over trivial details.  

## Design recipe for `(listof X)`

```
;; A (listof X) is one of:
;; * empty
;; (cons x (listof X) -> Any)

(define (listof-X-template lox)
	cond [(empty? lox) ...]
			 [else (... (first lox)... listof-X-template (rest lox))...])
```

## Filling in the templates

## Contracts for nonempty lists

- Require that the list must be nonempty for the function in question

## Strings and lists of characters

Racket notation for character `a` is `#\a`.  

Racket has built in string and list conversion functions.

```
(string->list "test")
(cons #\t (cons #\e (cons #\s (cons #\t empty))))
```
