## Conditionals pt. 2

## Simplifying conditional functions

```
(define (course-after-cs135 grade)
	(cond [(< grade 50) 'cs115] ; less than 50, take cs 115
		[(< grade 60) 'cs116] ; less than 60, take cs 116
		[else 'cs136]))				; greater/equal to 60, take cs 136
```

### Tests for conditional expressions
- Write at least one test for each possible answer in the expression
- Test should be simple and direct
- Write test cases for edge cases

- Some of your tests (including examples) will have been defined before the body of the function was written
	- These are known as __black-box tests__ because they are not based on details of the code
- Other tests may depend on the code, for example to check specific answers in cond expressions
	- These are known as __white-box tests__

### Writing Boolean tests

`check-expect` used for boolean tests
