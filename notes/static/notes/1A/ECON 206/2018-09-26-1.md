## Risk structure of interest rates

- the relationship among interest rates of different bonds with the same maturity

Key features of interest behavior for bonds of the same maturity (see figure 6-1)
1. Interest rate on different categories of bonds differ from one another in any given year
2. Spread between interest rates varies over time

Bond yields differ (sometimes substantially) across bonds of the same maturity. Why?

__Key factors:__
1. Risk of default
2. Liquidity
3. Income tax considerations

### Risk of default
- __Default__ occurs when the issuer of the bond is unable to (or unwilling) to make interest payments or pay off the face value when the bond matures
- Default risk is the probability of default

__Examples:__
- Mortgage default
- Soverign default
	- e.g. Greece
	- Puerto Rico, Jamaica

Government of Canada bonds are considered default-free
- This is because the gov't can simply raise taxes or print money to meet their obligations

__Risk premium:__ the spread between the interest rates on bonds with default risk and the interest rates on (same maturity) gov't Canada bonds.  

See table 6-1 for bond ratings

### Liquidity

- The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash
- Canada bonds are the easiest to sell quickly
	- Cost of selling a bond is low
	- Large number of buyers/sellers

How does the reduced liquidity of corporate bonds affect their interest rates relative to the interest rate on Canada bonds?
- use Supply and Demand analysis

### Income tax considerations

- interest payments on some bonds are exempt from income taxes

## Term structure of interest rates

- the relationship among interest rates on bonds with different maturities but identical risk, liquidity, and task characteristics
- bonds with identical risk, liquidity, and tax characteristics may have different interest rates because the time remaining to maturity is different

__Yield curve:__ a plot of the yield on bonds with differing terms to maturity but the same risk, liquidity and tax considerations  

__Upward-sloping:__ long-term rates are above short term rates  
__Flat:__ short- and long-term rates are the same  
__Downward-sloping (inverted):__ long term rates are below short term rates

### Facts that the Theory of Term Structure of Interest Rates must explain

1. Interest rates on bonds of different maturities move together over time
2. When short-term interest rates are low, yield curves are more likely to have an upward slope;  
  when short-term rates are high, yield curves are more likely to slope downward and be inverted
3. Yield curves almost always slope upward

__Three theories to explain the three facts:__  
1. Expectations theory (explains first two but not third)
2. Segmented markets theory (explains fact three but not first two)
3. Liquidity premium theory (combines the two theories to explain all three facts)

## Expectations Theory

- The interest rate on a long-term bond will equal an average of the short-term interest rates that people expect to occur over the life of the long-term bond

__Key assumption:__  
- Bond holders consider bonds with different maturities to be __perfect substitutes__

That is, buyers of bonds do not prefer bonds of one maturity over another; they will not hold any quantity of a bond if its expected return is less than that of another bond with a different maturity.  

### Example

Consider the two investment strategies
1. Purchase a 1y bond, and another after it matures
2. Purchase a 2y bond

Both strategies must have the same expected return.  

Let current interest rate on one-year bond to be 6\%. You expect the interest rate on next year's one-year bond to be 8\%. Then the expected return for buying two one-year bonds will average out to be 7\%.  

The expected return per year on the two-year bond must be 7% for you to be willing to purchase it.  

For an investment of \$1, consider the cohice of holding, for two periods, a two-period bond or two one-period bonds.

$i_t$ = today's (time $t$) interest rate on a one-period bond  
$i^e_{t+1}$ = interest rate on a one-period bond expected for next period (time t+1)  
$i_{2t}$ = today's (time $t$) interest rate on the two period bond -- assume that

__Expectations theory__  

can explain Fact 1: _interest rates on bonds with different maturities move together over time_. How?  

$$i_{nt} = \frac{i_t + i^e_{t+1} + i^e_{t+2} + ... + i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n}$$

can explain Fact 2: _When short-term interest rates are low, yield curves are more likely to have an upward slope; when short-term rates are high, yield curves are more likely to slope downward and be inverted

cannot explain fact 3: yield curves almost always slope upward

## Segmented Markets Theory

- The theory sees markets for different maturity bonds as separate and segmented

Bonds of different maturities are not substitutes at all.
- investors have preferences for onds of one maturity over another
- the interest rate for each bond with a different maturity is determined y the D for S of that bond
- if (risk-averse) investors generally prefer bonds with shorter maturities that have a less interest-rate risk, then this explains why yield curves usually slope upward (Fact 3)

However, it cannot explain Facts 1 and 2

## Liquidity premium theory

The interest rate on a long-term bond will equal an average of short-term interest rates expected to occur over the life of the long-term bond plus a liquidity premium that responds to supply and demand conditions for that bond

- Liquidity premium also referred to as a _term premium_

$$ i_{nt} = \frac{i_t + i^e_{t+1} + i^e_{t+2} + ... + i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n} + I_{nt}$$

where $I_{nt}$ is the liquidity premium for the n-period bond at time $t$.  

$I_{nt}$ is always positive and increases with the term to maturity  

Bonds of different maturities are partial (not prefect) substitutes

## Preferred Habitat Theory

- Closely related to the liquidity premium theory
- Assumption: investors have a preference for bonds of one maturity over another, a particular bond maturity (_preferred habitat_) in which they prefer to invest
- They will be willing to buy bonds of different maturities only if they earn a somewhat higher expected return
- Investors are likely to prefer short-term bonds over long-term bonds

## Liquidity premium and preferred habitat theories (cont'd)

$$ i_{nt} = \frac{i_t + i^e_{t+1} + i^e_{t+2} + ... + i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n} + I_{nt}$$

- Fact 1: interest rates on different bonds move together
	- explained by first term in equation

- Fact 2: yield curves slope upwar when short-term rates are low, and slope downward when short-term rates are high
	- Explained by the liquidity premium term in the first case and by a low expected average in the second case

- Fact 3: yield curves typically slope upward
	- Explained by a larger liquidity premium as the term to maturity lengthens

## MC questions

<hr>

According to the expectations theory of term structure,

B) interest rates on bonds of different maturities move together over time

D) buyers require an additional incentive to hold long-term bonds

__main assumption:__ as long as return is the same, no preference

__segmented:__ different maturities are in disjoint markets

<hr>

Ceterus paribus, when bonds become less widely traded, and as a consequence the market becomes less liquid, the demand curve for bonds shifts to the __left__ and the [price decreases] interest rate __increases__.

Price and interest rate are inversely related.

<hr>

A coupon bond that has no maturity date and on repayment of principal is called a __perpetuity__ or __consol__

<hr>

If a \$10K face value discount bond maturity in one year is selling for \$5K, then its yield to maturity is __100\%__

<hr>

Which of the following bonds would you prefer to be buying?

- 10K face, 10\% coupon, selling 9K
- 10K 7 10K
- 10K 9 10K
- 10K 10 10K
