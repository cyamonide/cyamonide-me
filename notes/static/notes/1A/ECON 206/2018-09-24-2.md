## Determinants of asset demand

1. __Wealth__
	- The total resources owned by the individual, including all assets
	- More wealth means more available to purchase assets
2. __Expected return__
	- the return expected over the next period on one asset relative to alternative assets
3. __Risk__
	- degree of uncertainty associated with the return on one asset relative to alternative assets
		- Risk Averse
			- Assume that people would like to purchase assets with a relatively low degree of uncertainty
4. __Liquidity__
	- the ease and speed with which an asset can be turned into cash relative to alternative assets

### Theory of Portfolio Choice
Ceterus paribus, the quantity demanded of an assets:
- positively related to wealth
- positively related to its expected return relative to alternative assets
- negatively related to the risk of its returns relative to alternative assets
- positively related to its liquidity relative to alternative assets

## Supply and Demand in the Bond Market

Suppose a one-year discount bond:  
$F$ = face value of the discount bond  
$P$ = current price

$$ i = \frac{F-P}{P}$$

Each bond price is associated with a particular level of the interest rate.  

If the holding period is one year, then the return on the bond is equal to the interest rate as measured by YTM.  

__Bond demand curve__ shows the relationship between $Q_d$ and the price ceterus paribus  
- Demand curve is downward sloping $\Rightarrow$ at lower prices of bond, $Q_d$ is higher

See Figure 5-1 in lecture notes.  

## Market Equilibrium

- __market equilibrium__ occurs when the amount that people are willing to buy equals the amount that people are willing to sell at a given price
- $B^d = B^s$ defines the equilibrium price (or interest rate)
- When $B^d > B^s$ there is excess demand; price will rise (or interest rate will fall)
- Reverse also true

## Shifts in the demand curve for bonds

1. Wealth
	- growing wealth shifts demand curve for bonds to the right
2. Expected returns
	- higher expected future interest rates shift the demand curve to the left (lower expected future return)
3. Expected inflation
	- an increase in the expected rate of inflation shifts the demand curve to shift to the left
4. Risk
	- an increase in the riskiness of bonds causes the demand curve to shift to the left
5. Liquidity
	- increased liquidity of bonds shifts the demand curve to the right

See table 5-2 for summary

## Shifts in the supply curve of bonds

1. Expected profitability of investment opportunities
	- higher expected profitability of investment opportunities shifts the supply curve to the right
2. Expected inflation
	- an increase in expected inflation shifts the supply curve to the right
	- encourage borrowing today, so increased issuance of bonds
3. Government budget
	- Increased budget deficit shifts the supply curve to the right
	- Finance deficit by selling bonds

## Changes in the interest rate due to changes in expected inflation
### _The Fisher Effect_

Changes in expected inflation affect BOTH demand and supply curves.

__Demand:__ if expected inflation rises, the demand for bonds falls, _shifting the demand curve to the left_
- Why does this happen?
	- Imagine you are a lender
	- Look at bonds vs real assets
	- Bonds give you nominal rate of return => lowers your expected return on bonds

__Supply:__ the rise i expected inflation also shifts the supply curve to the right
- Why does this happen?
	- Imagine you are a borrower (supplier)
	- The coupon payment in the future is expected to be a lower real payment

<hr>

- The equilibrium bond price falls, implying a rise in interest rate
- Thus when expected inflation rises, interest rates will rise
- This result has been named the __Fisher effect__ after Irving Fisher

Refer to Figure 5-5 to see the correlation between interest rate and expected inflation.  

## Changes in interest rate due to a Business Cycle Expansion

__Demand:__ as the economy expands, _wealth_ is likely increasing, and the _theory of portfolio of choice_ tells us that the demand for bonds will rise as well.  
Rightward shift in $D$.  

__Supply:__ as the economy expands, businesses are more willing to borrow because they are likely to have many profitable investment opportunities for which they will need financing.  
Rightward shift in $S$.

Supply curve shifts more than the demand curve such that the new equilibrium interest rate rises during economic expansion.  

Interest rate tends to increase during expansion and decrease in recession.  

## Supply and Demand in the Market for Money: _The Liquidity Preference Framework_

- an alternative model for determining EQ interest rate, developed by John Maynard Keynes, is known as the __liquidity preference framework__
- EQ interest rates are determined by the S&D for money
- Two ways to hold wealth: _Money_ and _Bonds_
- Total wealth equals total amount of money and bounds  
  $B^S + M^S = B^d + M^d$  
	$B^S - B^d = M^d - M^S$
- Thus if the bond market clears, so too should the money market

### Money demand in the Liquidity Preference Framework (LPF)

- as the interest rate increases:
	- the OC of holding money increases
	- the relative expected return of money decreases
		- and therefore the $Q_d$ of money decreases
- Quantity of money demanded and hte interest rate are negatively related

### Money supply in the LPF

- Assume that the supply of money is controlled by the central bank
- Let $M^S =$ \$300 B

## Shifts in the Demand curve for money

- __Income effect__
	- a higher level of income causes the demand for money at each interest rate to increase and the demand curve to shift to the right
	- when people earn more, they would likely like to spend more, and so they might need to carry around more cash
- __Price-Level effect__
	- a rise in the price level causes the demand for money at each interest rate to increase and the demand curve to shift to the right

## Shifts in the Supply curve for money

- Assume supply of money controlled by central bank
- an increase in the money supply engineered by BoC will shift the supply curve for money to the right (__liquidity effect__)

See table 5-4 for summary of all factors.

## Money and interest rates

- LPC leads to the conclusion that an increase in the money supply will lower interest rates: the liquidity effect
	- __BUT__ Friedman noted that an increase in the money supply might have other effects on the economy that make interest rates rise
- __Income effect__ of an increase in the money supply is a rise in the interest rate because increasing the money supply leads to an expansionary influence on the economy (rise in national income and wealth)
- __Price-level effect__ of an increase in the money supply is a rise in interest rates in response to the rise in the overall price level
- __Expected-inflation effect__ of an increase in the money supply is a rise in interest rates in response to the rise in the expected inflation rate

See figure 5-11. Data shows that most of the time it is `a` or `b`.
