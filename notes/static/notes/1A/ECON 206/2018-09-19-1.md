## Interest rates

- Factors to consider:
	- Inflation rate
	- Default risk
	- Opportunity cost of waiting to spend your money

Consider a simple loan: _Loan $100 today and require $110 repayment in one year_  

__simple interest rate__ example:  
$i = \$10/\$100 = 0.10$ or $10\%$

$$ principal \cdot (1+i) = future $$

__Present value:__ a dollar paid to you one year from now is less valuable than a dollar paid to you today

- $i$ links the financial future with the financial present

In general, $\$100 \cdot (1+i)^n$ where $n$ is the number of years and $i$ is the interest rate.

### Discounting the Future: Simple Present Value

$PV$ = today's present value  
$CF$ = future cash flow or payment
$i$ = interest rate

$$ PV \cdot (1 + i)^n = CF $$
$$ PV = \frac{CF}{(1+i)^n} $$

### Four types of credit market instruments
- Simple Loan
	- One payment (principal and interest) at the maturity date
- Fixed payment loan (aka fully amortized loan)
	- makes the same payment, consisting of a part of the principal and interest, every period (such as a month) for a set number of years
	- multiple fixed payments at pre-specified dates
- Coupon bond
	- makes fixed-interest payment (coupon payment) every period until the maturity date, when a specified final amount (face value or par value) is repaid
	- For example, a coupon bond with $1000 face value might pay you a coupon payment of $100 per year until the maturity date, and then repay the face value of $1000 at maturity
- Discount bond (aka zero-coupon bond)
	- A bond bought at a price below its face value (i.e, bought at a "discount") that pays zero coupons, and face value is repaid at maturity date

#### Similarities
- Simple loans and discount bonds make payments only at maturity
- Fixed-payment loans and coupon bonds make payments every period (or at regular intervals) until maturity

__Yield to Maturity__ is the interest rate that __equates__ the present value of all cash flow payments received from a debt instrument with its value today (the current price)

### Simple Loan
$PV$ = amount borrowed = \$100  
$CF$ = cash flow in one year = \$110  
$n$ = number of years  

$$ \$100 = \frac{\$100}{(1+i)^1} $$

Thus, the yield to maturity is 10% which is equal to the simple interest rate.

### Fixed Payment Loan
$LV$ = loan value  
$FP$ = fixed yearly payment  
$n$ = years until maturity  

$$ LV = \frac{FP}{(1+i)} + \frac{FP}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{FP}{(i+1)^3} + ... + \frac{FP}{(1+i)^n} $$

Suppose you need a \$100,000 loan. You take out a fixed payment loan from the bank that has an annual interest rate of 7%.  

What is the yearly payment to the bank if you wish to pay off the loan in 20 years?  

$$ \$100,000 = \frac{FP}{(1+0.07)} + \frac{FP}{(1+0.07)^2} + \frac{FP}{(i+0.07)^3} + ... + \frac{FP}{(1+0.07)^20} $$

$$FP = \$9439.29$$

#### Another example

Suppose you need a $1000 loan. You take out a fixed-payment loan from the bank that requires you to make a yearly payment of \$85.81 for the next 25 years.  

What is the YTM?

$$ \$1000 = \frac{\$85.81}{1+i} + ... $$

Cannot solve by hand; requires a computer  

Solution: $i = 0.07$ so $YTM = 7\%$  

### Coupon bond

$P$ = price of coupon bond  
$C$ = yearly coupon payment  
$F$ = face value of the bond  
$n$ = years to maturity

present value aka present discounted value  
interest rate aka discount rate  

$$ P = \frac{C}{(1+i)} + \frac{C}{(1+i)^2} +  \frac{C}{(1+i)^3} + ... +  \frac{C}{(1+i)^n}  +  \frac{F}{(1+i)^n} $$

Suppose:  
$P = \$1000$  
$F = \$1000$  
$C - \$100$ (i.e. coupon rate); $n = 10$

Calculation left as an exercise for the reader.  

$YTM = 10\%$  

#### Three facts about coupon bonds
- when the coupon bond is priced at its face value, the yield to maturity equals the coupon rate
- the price of a coupon bond and the yield to maturity are negatively related
	- as the yield to maturity rises, the price of the bond fall
- the yield to maturity is greater than the coupon rate when the bond price is below its face value
	- the yield to maturity is less than the coupon rate when the bond price is above is face value

### Consol or Perpetuity

A bond with no maturity date that does not repay principal but pays a fixed coupon

$P_c$ = price of consol  
$C$ = yearly interest payment  
$i_c$ = yield to maturity of the consol

$$ P_c = \frac{C}{1+i_c} + \frac{C}{(1 + i_c)^2} + ... $$

$$ i_c = \frac{C}{P_c} $$

### Discount bond

$F$ = face value of the discount bond  
$P$ = current price of the discount bond

$$ i = \frac{F-P}{P} $$

Rearranging,

$$ P = \frac{F}{1+i} $$

The YTM ($i$) is negatively related to the current bond price

## The distinction between interest rates and returns

How well a person does financially by holding a bond for some period of time is determined by the __rate of return ($R$)__.  

- The __rate of return__ ($R$) depends on coupons received ($C$) __and__ the price for which the bond is eventually sold:

$$ R = \frac{C}{P_t} + \frac{P_{t+1}-P_t}{P_t} $$

where: $C/P_t = \textrm{current yield} = i_c$

$(P_{t+1}-P_t)/P_t =$ rate of capital gain $= g$  

<hr>

Refer to Table 4.2.  

In table 4.2, the holding period is 1 year but term to maturity runs from 1 to 30 years.  

- Look at second to last row:
	- Say interest rates rise to 20% at the beginning of the second year
	- "Price Next Year" column 4 = $\$100/(1+0.2) + \$1000/(1+0.2) = \$916.6$
	- If you do sell it a year in advance, you are selling it at a loss

$$ \textrm{Rate of capital gain} = \frac{916.6-1000}{1000} = -0.083 \textrm{ or} -8.3\% $$

- Look at 5-year maturity bond

What price will you get if you sell the bond?

$$ P = \frac{\$100}{(1+0.20)} + \frac{\$100}{(1+0.20)^2} + ... + \frac{\$100}{(1+0.20)^4} = \$741 $$

Rate of capital gain is $(741-1000)/1000 = -0.259$, or capital loss of $25.9\%$  

When the interest rate goes up, you usually incur a capital loss if you sell before maturity.  

Rate of return = 10% + (-25.9) = -15.9.

### Summary

- The return (i.e. rate of return) equals the yield to maturity only if the holding period equals the time to maturity
- A rise in interest rates is associated with a fall in bond prices, resulting in a capital loss if time to maturity is longer than the holding period
- Similarly, the more distant a bond's maturity, the greater the size of the percentage price change associated with an interest rate change
- The more distant a bond's maturity, the lower the rate of return that occurs as a result of an increase in the interest rate
- Even if a bond has a substantial interest rate, its return can be negative if interest rates rise

## Interest-rate risk

The risk level associated with an asset's return that results from interest-rate changes is its __interest-rate risk__.  

Prices and rate of return for _long-term_ bonds are more volatile than those for shorter-term bonds.  

There is __no__ interest-rate risk for any bond whose time to maturity matches the holding period.

## Real and Nominal interest rates

- __Nominal interest rates__ make no allowance for inflation
- __Real interest rates__ are the interest rates adjusted for the inflation rate
	- more accurately reflects the cost of borrowing

Nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding cash in your wallet.  
- This is what banks give you in terms of chequing or savings account interest rates  

__Real interest rates:__  

- _Ex ante_ real interest rate is adjusted for _expected_ interest rate
- _Ex post_ real interest rate is adjusted for _actual_ interest rate

__Fisher equation:__  
$i$ = nominal interest rate  
$r$ = real interest rate  
$\pi^e$ = expected inflation rate  

Suppose you have \$1.  

$$ \frac{1i}{1+\pi^e} $$
$$ (1+r) = \frac{1+i}{1+\pi^e}$$
$$ (1+r)(1+\pi^e) = (1+i)$$
$$ 1 + r + \pi^e + r\pi^e = (1+i) $$
$$ i = r + \pi^e = r\pi^e $$
$$ i \approx r + \pi^e$$

- When the real interest rate is low, there are greater incentives to borrow
- Low real interest rates reduces the incentives to lend
- The real interest rate is a better indicator of the incentives to borrow/lend
